# SimplyStart     
A _vim_ module with some basic settings, will probably change as my needs change      
## Why?
None whatsoever, honestly, if you want a quick start, go with
[vim-sensible](https://github.com/tpope/vim-sensible.git), it's probably more
than sufficient. These are just settings that I wanted and added gradually, or
ones that I found in other configurations that I thought would be neat-o to use.
So feel free to look through and yank the stuff you want, and toss the rest. 
## Installation      
1) `cd ~/.vim`
2) `mkdir -p pack/plugins/start`
3) `git clone git@github.com:msgross/simplystart.git
~/.vim/pack/plugins/start/simplystart`      
Note: A vim package manager can probably handle this as well, but I haven't
personally tried that out 
## Dependencies
flazz maintains a pretty large repository of theme options, we personally use
minimalist as our default if it's available, desert (which comes with vim by
default) otherwise.
