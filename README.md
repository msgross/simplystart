## Installation      
1) `cd ~/.vim`
2) `mkdir -p pack/plugins/start`
3) `git clone git@github.com:msgross/simplystart.git`
Note: A vim package manager can probably handle this as well, but I haven't
personally tried that out 
## Dependencies
flazz maintains a pretty large repository of theme options, we personally use
minimalist as our default if it's available, desert (which comes with vim by
default) otherwise.
